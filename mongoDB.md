# MongoDB

### [Check out their website here](https://www.mongodb.com/)

# Open-source or Commercial?
> According to information found on their website, MongoDB is an open source database.

# MongoDB's Data Model
> MongoDB provides two different data models depending on what its user needs: The Embedded Data Model or the Normalized Data Model. The Normalized Data Model allows users to reference other documents in their main document whereas the Embedded Model allows users to embed all docs into one document. Due to its multiple data models offered depending on what the user needs, MongoDB can be considered a NoSQL Database.  

# MongoDB's Hosting Model (embedded, client/server, etc)
> MongoDB utilizes the Cloud Hosting Model in its processes.

# How Java or Python access it
> Given that MongoDB stores data in documents whose formats are similar to JSON, it is fairly easy for Java to access it. You can access MongoDB through java by creating an instance of a MongoClient and then utilizing the .getDatabase object of the mongoClient class to retrieve the data base you're looking for
