# Redis

### [Check out their website here](https://redis.io/)

## Open-source or Commercial?
> According to information found on their website, Redis is an open-source, in-memory data store that is utilized as a database.

## Redis' Data Model
> Through looking at their website again, Redis uses a NoSQL Data Model in that it doesn't force a schema design onto a user's data. Rather, it allows the user to choose from a plethora of different open-ended designs depending on what the user needs.

## Redis' Hosting Model (embedded, client/server, etc)
> Redis traditionally uses the client/server model. However, if you utilize Redis Cloud Enterprises, it can be considered a cloud-hosted model.

## How Java or Python access it
> You can use Python to access Redis through first running a Redis server through the command line. From here, you would use pip to install the redis client library and then write the code needed for your database.
